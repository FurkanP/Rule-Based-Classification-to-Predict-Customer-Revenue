# Rule-Based Classification for Customer Revenue Prediction

# Business Problem
A gaming company wants to create new customer definitions (persona) based on some characteristics of their customers and form segments according to these new customer definitions. They aim to predict the average revenue that these segments can bring to the company.

For example, the company wants to determine the average revenue from a 25-year-old male user from Turkey using an iOS device.

# Dataset Story
The Persona Dataset contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information about the users who purchased these products. The dataset consists of records generated from each sales transaction. This means the table is not deduplicated, implying that a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.
